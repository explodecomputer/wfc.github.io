&lt;p&gt;The Within Family Consortium is a group of researchers who are interested in using datasets of related individuals to understand how the human genome influences a broad range of medical and socioeconomic traits. Our research involves researchers, expertise and methods from a wide range of fields. We are keen to promote high quality reproducible research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aims and objectives&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;To undertake within family analyses across all available studies that have sampled related individuals.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Estimate direct genetic effects&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Estimate and understand indirect genetic effects&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The consortium aims to help undertake projects using datasets of related individuals. Many of these projects require a lot of data, and more samples than are available in any one study. Therefore the best way to conduct these studies is to run analyses in all available studies, that have capacity to contribute. The model we are currently using is to distribute automated scripts and pipelines to studies to minimize the requirement for analyst time at each study, this federated model all removes the need to transfer data between institutions and countries.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="Welcome" /><summary type="html">Welcome to the Within Family Consortium</summary></entry></feed>
